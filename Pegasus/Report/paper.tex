\title{Generating Pegasus with a Fully Connected and Variational Autoencoder architecture}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
    This abstract should be short and concise, about 8-10 lines long.
    This paper proposes using a FC-VAE to generate images that look like a Pegasus.  Variational Autoencoders are a powerful class of generative models. Unlike Autoencoders they aim to regualise the distribution of their encoding to ensure that good properties are captured in thier latent space and hencee moree effectivley can be used to generatee new data. The paper investivates using k-means clustering over latent space for feature extraction. Then usees linear interrpolation between features to geneeatre peegasus images.

\section{Methodology}
The method is to train an autoencoder~\cite{kramer1991nonlinear}, by minimising the squared L2 loss:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{\textrm{AE}} = \mathbb{E}_{\vx\sim p_{\textrm{data}}}[\, \lVert \vx - D(E(\vx)) \rVert^2 ]
\end{equation}
The methodology should be very concise and the mathematical notation should try to follow \href{https://v1.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-iclr-2021-conference-submission/mmpfhsxmqdkp.pdf}{the ICLR conference guidlines \faExternalLink}. If you are not familiar with \LaTeX, you can use \href{https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php}{this online \LaTeX~equation editor \faExternalLink}. You may want to include an architectural diagram:

    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/architecture.pdf}
\end{center}
The architectural diagram above was created using Inkscape and exported to a PDF. This was then uploaded to the figures directory on the left.

\section{Investigating class subclassification}
To make a pegasus you may initially think of it as a cross between a horse and a bird. However this poses issues, namely that birds contain many features you would not expect to find on a pegasus, such as a beak. Given that we intend to create our pegasus via interpolation between a picture of a horse and a picture of a bird it would be useful to select pictures of birds that have useful features i.e. wings and exclude pictures containing useless features like beaks. Hence I investigate using k-means over the latent space of a class to subdivide that class.

\section{Results}
The results look very blurry, where the best batch of images looks like this:
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/best-batch.png}
\end{center}
From this batch, the most Pegasus-like image (with quite a stretch of the imagination) is:
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.075\textwidth]{figures/best-pegasus.png}
\end{center}

\section{Limitations}
It's very difficult to see anything that looks like a Pegasus. In the future, this could be improved by training for more than 10 epochs, although this was not possible due to the time constraints.

\section*{Bonuses}
This submission has a total bonus of -4 marks (a penalty), as it is trained only on CIFAR-10, and the Pegasus has a dark body colour.
